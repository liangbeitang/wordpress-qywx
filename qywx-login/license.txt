### GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
Version 2, June 1991

Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110 - 1301, USA

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

### Preamble
The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General
Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share
and change free software--to make sure the software is free for
all its users.  This General Public License applies to most of
the Free Software Foundation's software and to any other program
whose authors commit to using it.  (Some other Free Software
Foundation software is covered by the GNU Lesser General Public
License instead.)  You can apply it to your programs, too.

When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that
you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and
charge for this service if you wish), that you receive source code
or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or
use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you know you can do
these things.

To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if
you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.

For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights
that you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can
get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they
know their rights.

We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
distribute and/or modify the software.

Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on,
we want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original,
so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the
original authors' reputations.

Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents.
We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will
individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program
proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must
be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.

The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.

### TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

#### 0. Definitions.
"License" shall mean the terms and conditions for copy-
ing, distribution and modification as defined by Sections 1
through 9 of this document.

"Licensor" shall mean the copyright holder or entity
licensing the software under this License.

"Program" shall mean any copyrightable work licensed
under this License.  Each licensee is addressed as "you".
Activities other than copying, distribution and modifica-
tion are not covered by this License; they are outside its
scope.  The act of running the Program is not restricted, and
the output from the Program is covered only if its contents
constitute a work based on the Program (independent of an
use of the Program in a tool for writing).

"Work based on the Program" shall mean either the Program
or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a
work containing the Program or a portion of it, either verbatim
or with modifications and/or translated into another language.
(Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the
term "modification".)

"Modified Version" shall mean any work based on the Program,
whether in source code or executable form, that is not the Pro-
gram.  For purposes of this License, a work that consists of the
Program or a portion of it combined with other software that is
not based on the Program shall not be considered a Modified
Version, provided the combined work as a whole is not itself a
derivative work under copyright law.  Such a combination is
herein called an "aggregate" work.

"Recipient" shall mean anyone who receives the Program or
a work based on it under this License.

#### 1. Source Code.
The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of
the work for making modifications to it.  For an executable
work, complete source code means all the source code for all
modules it contains, plus any associated interface definition
files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installa-
tion of the executable.  However, as a special exception, the
source code distributed need not include anything that is nor-
mally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the
major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating
system on which the executable runs, unless that component itself
accompanies the executable.

If the work is source code, the source code is its own com-
plete source code.

#### 2. Basic Permissions.
You may copy, distribute and modify the Program under the
terms of this License, provided that you respect the following
conditions:

- You must retain the copyright notice and this License in all
copies or substantial portions of the Program.

- You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that
in whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or
any part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all
third parties under the terms of this License.

- If you modify a copy of the Program and display or publish
the modified copy, you must make available the source code of
the modified copy under the terms of this License.

- You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a
copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection in
exchange for a fee.

#### 3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti - Circumvention Law.
No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological
measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article
11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or
similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such
measures.

When you distribute a covered work, you waive any legal power to
enforce against the work's users the law's restrictions on circum-
venting technological measures.

#### 4. Combining Other Software with the Program.
You may combine the Program with other software not covered by
this License into a single aggregate work, and distribute the
aggregate work, provided that you do not place any further restric-
tions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted to them
under this License.

If the Program is combined with other software that is covered
by another license, you must ensure that the additional software
is distributed under terms that allow the combination to be distrib-
uted under the terms of this License.

#### 5. Conveying Modified Versions.
You may convey a Modified Version of the Program under the
terms of this License, provided that you also meet the following
conditions:

- You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that
in whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or
any part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all
third parties under the terms of this License.

- If the Modified Version is in source code form, you must make
available the source code of the Modified Version under the
terms of this License.

- If the Modified Version is in executable form, you must make
available the source code of the Modified Version under the
terms of this License, unless the Modified Version is an aggre-
gate work that meets the requirements of Section 4.

- You must accompany the Modified Version with a prominent
notice stating that you have modified it, and giving a relevant
date.

- You must retain the copyright notice and this License in all
copies or substantial portions of the Modified Version.

- You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that
in whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or
any part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all
third parties under the terms of this License.

#### 6. Conveying Non - Source Forms.
You may convey a non - source form of the Program, provided
that you also meet the following conditions:

- You must make available the source code of the Program under
the terms of this License, unless the Program is an aggregate
work that meets the requirements of Section 4.

- You must accompany the non - source form with a prominent
notice stating that the source code of the Program is available
under the terms of this License, and providing an offer to pro-
vide the source code.

- You must retain the copyright notice and this License in all
copies or substantial portions of the non - source form.

#### 7. Termination.
You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program
is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this
License.  However, parties who have received copies, or rights,
from you under this License will not have their licenses termi-
nated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.

#### 8. Disclaimer of Warranty.
THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED
BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING
